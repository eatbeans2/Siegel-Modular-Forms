# Siegel-Modular-Forms
This repository contains a collection of related programs regarding Siegel modular forms and binary quadratic forms. One folder generates the classical class groups of binary quadratic forms for a negative discriminant. Another expands this to class groups under a new definition of equivalence under SL_2(Z)/Gamma_0(N).
